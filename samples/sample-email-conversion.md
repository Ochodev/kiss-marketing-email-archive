## Message Content

Hi William,

Thank you for the comprehensive strategy document you sent over last week. The team reviewed it thoroughly and we're very excited about the proposed approach for our Q2 mobile app launch.

### Key Points We Love:

1. **Phased Launch Approach** - The idea of beta testing with our existing customer base first is brilliant. This will help us:
   - Gather real user feedback before full launch
   - Build anticipation and word-of-mouth
   - Identify and fix bugs in a controlled environment

2. **Influencer Strategy** - The micro-influencer focus aligns perfectly with our brand values. We especially appreciate:
   - The emphasis on authentic partnerships vs. one-off posts
   - The mix of tech reviewers and lifestyle influencers
   - The proposed engagement metrics and tracking

3. **Content Calendar** - The 90-day runway gives us enough time to build momentum. The weekly themes are spot-on:
   - Weeks 1-4: Teaser campaign
   - Weeks 5-8: Beta launch and testimonials
   - Weeks 9-12: Full launch and amplification

### Questions and Adjustments:

**Budget Allocation:**
We'd like to shift more budget toward the influencer program. Specifically:
- **Increase** influencer budget from $25K to $35K
- **Decrease** paid social advertising from $30K to $20K

Our reasoning: We believe the authentic influencer content will perform better than traditional ads for our target demographic (25-40 year-olds, tech-savvy).

Can you revise the budget breakdown and let us know if this impacts any other aspects of the strategy?

**Timeline Concern:**
Our product team just informed me that the app won't be ready until **April 15** instead of April 1. This pushes our soft launch back two weeks.

**Impact Questions:**
- Does this affect our influencer outreach timeline?
- Should we adjust our content calendar?
- Will this impact any paid media bookings?

**Additional Channel - Podcast Sponsorships:**
We're also considering adding a podcast sponsorship component to reach our audience during their commutes. Do you have experience with podcast advertising for app launches?

We're thinking 3-4 mid-tier tech/productivity podcasts with episodes releasing during our launch window. Budget: ~$15K (would come from the paid social reduction).

### Documentation Attached:

I've attached two files for your review:

1. **App-Launch-Strategy-v2.pdf** - Your original strategy doc with our team's annotations and feedback
2. **Q2-Budget-Breakdown.xlsx** - Our proposed budget reallocation with justifications

### Next Steps:

Could we schedule a call early next week to align on these changes? I want to make sure we're all on the same page before we start execution.

**My Availability:**
- **Monday, March 18:** 2:00 PM - 4:00 PM PST
- **Tuesday, March 19:** 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM PST  
- **Wednesday, March 20:** 1:00 PM - 5:00 PM PST

Let me know what works best for your schedule. Happy to jump on a Zoom call or do a phone call - whatever is easiest.

Looking forward to moving this forward! This is going to be a game-changer for us.
