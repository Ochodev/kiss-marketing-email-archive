# Sold - KISS Marketing Acquisition Story

Hey Will,

For the past 5 years, I owned a digital marketing agency called KISS Marketing.

We ran ads, built websites, and sold a CRM to help gyms organize their sales pipeline.

It was cool while it lasted, but last month I sold it to **Gym Member Machine**.

More on "why I sold" later this week because there are a ton of business lessons that came from it.

I had multiple companies interested in buying KISS Marketing because it was a profitable company, had a good retention rate, and a solid team.

But here's why I chose GMM over all the others…

## 1. Personal Relationship with Owner
I personally knew the owner, GR Hoff. I've known GR for over a decade, and he was the first guy that ever ran Facebook ads at my gym. He was damn good and was the ad manager behind the most historic marketing campaign in the history of my gym.

## 2. Client Validation
I had clients in my mastermind that were already using GMM and were happy. A big driver in my decision was talking to them personally, and based on their happiness with GMM — that people normally hate — it made me feel really good.

## 3. Team Retention
When you sell a company, many times the employees become casualties in the sale. Not in this case. All the team members at KISS Marketing retained their jobs and have joined forces with the existing team at GMM.

## 4. Superior Retention Metrics
You can tell a lot about a company based on their churn rate. If it's low, it means there's great work being done. At KISS Marketing, we were very good at around 3% on average… GMM was even lower, which is kind of hard to imagine.

## 5. Long-term Partnership
I was not looking just to dump the agency. I was looking for a long-term relationship with a company I trusted and could refer my clients to for digital marketing services.

### Special Offer
To celebrate the partnership, GMM is offering $500 off the first month of marketing services to the first 12 gyms that get rolling with them.
