Hi Will,

Thank you for being a Salesforce customer. I am your Renewal Manager, and will be working with your Account Executive on your upcoming renewal.

Your Salesforce subscription for **Gym Member Machine** will be renewing on **1/27/2026**. An increase of up to 9% will be applied to your estimated renewal amount. This increase supports continued improvements of services, products, and expansion of features.

If you'd like to make any changes or discuss in more detail, please contact me directly prior to the contract end date 1/27/2026.

We look forward to our continued partnership.

Kind regards,
