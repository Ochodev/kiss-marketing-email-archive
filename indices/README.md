# Indices Directory

This directory contains comprehensive indices for navigating and discovering emails across the archive.

## Index Types

### 1. Chronological Master Index
**File:** `chronological-index.md`

Time-based master list of all emails organized by year and month. Use this when you know approximately when an email was sent/received.

### 2. Sender/Recipient Index
**File:** `sender-recipient-index.md`

People-focused directory showing all communications with specific individuals and organizations. Use this to find all emails from/to a particular person.

### 3. Topic Index
**File:** `topic-index.md`

Subject and project-based cross-reference. Use this to explore emails related to specific campaigns, projects, or themes.

## Templates

The `templates/` folder contains reusable templates for generating indices:

- **monthly-index-template.md** - Template for generating monthly email summaries
- **client-index-template.md** - Template for client-specific email directories

## Usage

### Searching Across Indices

**Find by Date:**
```
Open chronological-index.md → Navigate to YYYY/MM → Find email
```

**Find by Person:**
```
Open sender-recipient-index.md → Search for name → View email list
```

**Find by Topic:**
```
Open topic-index.md → Browse categories → Find related emails
```

### Updating Indices

Indices should be updated:
- **Daily** during active archiving
- **Weekly** for new email additions
- **Monthly** for comprehensive reviews
