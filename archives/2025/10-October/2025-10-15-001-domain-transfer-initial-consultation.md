## Message Content

Hi William,

Thanks for taking my call last week regarding our domain situation. After discussing with my business partner, we're ready to move forward with transferring GymSupps.org to your management and rebuilding the website from scratch.

### Current Situation:

**Domain Status:**
- Currently registered with GoDaddy under our account
- Expires: March 2026
- No domain lock or transfer restrictions
- DNS currently pointing to outdated hosting provider

**Website Issues:**
- Built on deprecated WordPress version (5.2 - yikes, I know)
- Mobile experience is terrible
- Loading times over 8 seconds
- Not secure (no SSL certificate)
- Difficult to update content ourselves
- Our current "web guy" is MIA

### Our Goals:

1. **Professional Domain Management** - We want peace of mind that our domain is secure and properly configured
2. **Modern, Fast Website** - Clean design showcasing our supplement products and educational content
3. **Mobile-First** - 70% of our traffic is mobile
4. **E-commerce Ready** - Not selling online yet, but planning to within 6 months
5. **Easy Content Updates** - Need to publish articles and update product info weekly
6. **Strong SEO** - Want to rank for fitness supplement keywords

### Budget & Timeline:

**Budget:** $8,000-$12,000 for initial build  
**Monthly:** $200-$400 for hosting, maintenance, domain management

**Timeline:**  
We'd like to launch before Black Friday (November 29) to capture holiday supplement sales. Is that realistic?

### Questions:

1. Can you handle the entire domain transfer process so we don't mess anything up?
2. What's your recommended platform? (WordPress vs. something else?)
3. Do you provide hosting, or should we arrange that separately?
4. Can we migrate our existing blog content? (About 50 articles)
5. What's included in ongoing maintenance?

### Next Steps:

I'm available for a video call this week to discuss:
- Monday, Oct 16: 10 AM - 3 PM PST
- Tuesday, Oct 17: 1 PM - 5 PM PST
- Thursday, Oct 19: 9 AM - 2 PM PST

We're excited to finally get this project moving. Our current setup is holding back our business growth.

Looking forward to working with you!
