## Resource Requirements

### Time Investment

**Per Email Average:** 2-3 minutes
- Extraction: 30 seconds
- Conversion: 45 seconds
- Metadata entry: 60 seconds
- Review & commit: 15 seconds

**Total Time Estimate:**
- 14,136 emails × 2.5 minutes = 589 hours
- Add 20% for QA and indexing = 707 hours
- Spread over 6 months = ~120 hours/month
- Or ~30 hours/week (part-time)

**Recommended Pace:**
- **Light:** 2 hours/day = 40-50 emails/day = 200-250/week
- **Medium:** 4 hours/day = 80-100 emails/day = 400-500/week ⭐ Recommended
- **Intensive:** 6 hours/day = 120-150 emails/day = 600-750/week

### Tools & Technology

**Required:**
- Git and GitHub account ✅
- Text editor (VS Code recommended)
- Email client access (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Email export capability

**Recommended:**
- Python 3.x (for automation scripts)
- Pandoc (for HTML → Markdown conversion)
- YAML validator
- Markdown linter
- Grep/ripgrep (for advanced search)

**Optional:**
- Custom conversion scripts
- Metadata extraction tools
- Batch processing automation
- Git LFS (for large attachments)

### Skills Required

**Essential:**
- Email management
- Git basics (commit, push, branch)

## Batch Processing Strategy

### Approach 1: Manual + Tooling (Recommended)

**Workflow:**
1. Export emails in monthly batches from email client
2. Use Pandoc to convert HTML → Markdown
3. Manually add metadata (use templates)
4. Review for quality (10% sample)
5. Commit daily batches to GitHub
6. Update indices weekly

**Pros:**
- Full control over quality
- Learn patterns and improve
- Flexibility for edge cases
- Best for accuracy

**Cons:**
- More time per email
- Manual metadata entry
- Repetitive tasks

**Best For:** High-value accuracy, learning phase, complex emails

### Approach 2: Heavily Automated

**Workflow:**
1. Bulk export to MBOX format
2. Custom Python script extracts metadata
3. Automated conversion to Markdown
4. Manual review of edge cases only
5. Batch commit to repository

**Pros:**
- Much faster overall
- Consistent formatting
- Scalable to large volumes
- Reduced manual effort

**Cons:**
- Requires script development
- May miss nuances
- Harder to handle exceptions
- Initial setup time

**Best For:** Large volumes, simpler emails, technical users

### Approach 3: Hybrid (Best Balance) ⭐

**Workflow:**
1. Automated extraction and initial conversion
2. Manual metadata enrichment (tags, notes, context)
3. Automated formatting validation
4. Manual review of high-priority emails
5. Automated index generation

**Pros:**
- Speed + quality balance
- Automate repetitive tasks
- Human judgment where needed
- Best of both approaches

**Cons:**
- Requires both skill sets
- Some setup overhead
- Need to maintain scripts

**Best For:** This project - 14K emails with varying importance

**Recommended Hybrid Process:**
```
1. [AUTO] Export monthly batch → MBOX
2. [AUTO] Extract basic metadata → YAML
3. [AUTO] Convert body → Markdown
4. [MANUAL] Add tags, context, notes
5. [MANUAL] Review priority emails (20%)
6. [AUTO] Validate formatting
7. [MANUAL] Git commit with message
8. [AUTO] Generate monthly index
```
